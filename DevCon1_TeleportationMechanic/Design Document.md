**Design Rationale:**

With Open World games and bigger games continuing to become more and more popular, having some sort of fast travel system is becoming quite necessary to mitigate the annoyance of tedious traveling, allowing players to focus more on main core part of the game, helping give players more immersion. While yes, some people tend to run around maps on feet and explore the maps that the Level Designers were able to create, having some sort of fast travel system will help players who just want to follow through with the games narrative and quest objectives be able to do so without the frustration of needing to walk everywhere on feet. 

Our prototype will be designed to explore teleportation as a mechanic inside of a 3D environment. Our goal is not intended on making a a fully fleshed out fast travel system, but to test out how teleportation could impact a players game experience inside of a smaller scaled down space. 

Our rationale behind this prototype will be to spark curiosity from players, a sort of "**Where will this take me?"** kind of reaction, while also reducing the frustration of unnecessary and long traversal. 


**Objective:**

Our main objective with this prototype is to try and test whether or not a teleportation mechanic can improve players mobility by reducing the idea of unnecessary long on feet traversing, or would it introduce more confusion among them. We would like to try and look and see how players can experience the teleportation and whether or not it feels intuitive or disruptive. 

To do this we will firstly place 2 teleporters on the map that will both go to and from each other. That is going to be our main objective for the prototype. Just trying to make an easy cheap but solid working teleportation system. By completing this prototype we will be able to allow for players help give us feedback and a better understanding of the potential of teleportation inside of video games. 

Our objective is not to develop a fully fleshed out fast travel system, but to simply answer the design question: **Can teleportation be used in a way to balance player convenience with game engagement.** 

- Support level creation by cutting down on time
- Simple and efficient traveling 


**Core Statement:**

Is to create and develop a teleportation mechanic where a player enters a trigger/hitbox zone and is instantly transported into a different area of the map.
